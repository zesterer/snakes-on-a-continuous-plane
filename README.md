## What is Snakes On A Continuous Game?
The game was designed and built for the Ludum Dare 34 competition. It's a quick game, best played in multi-player mode. Each player controls a snake, aiming to collect food and grow in order to defeat your opponents. There exist coloured powerups that give you certain powers. Blue food makes you move faster. Red food gives you the ability to eat the tails of your opponents.
